Welcome to my creating 3D animations fully responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JS! In this project, you can see how to create a unique and engaging scrolling animation using the power of canvas.

You'll be amazed at the incredible 3D animations you can create with just a few lines of code. I do the step-by-step process of building a captivating animation that features a Korean guy moving and making various facial expressions as you scroll the screen.

I start this project by setting up the HTML structure and CSS styling to create the canvas element that will serve as our animation stage. Then, I dive into the JavaScript code, where we'll use various techniques to manipulate the canvas and create the 3D effect.

And in this project I learn how to use JavaScript to control the movement, rotation, and facial expressions of the Korean guy, making him come to life on the screen. We'll also show you how to utilize CSS animations to add smooth transitions and visual effects to enhance the overall animation.
